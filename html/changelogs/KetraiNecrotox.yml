# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.

  - balance: "Tracer cost reduced post activation, 110 => 70."
  - balance: "Branch cost reduced 120 => 90."

  - balance: "Infector cost reduced from 105 => 100"
  - balance: "Enhanced infector cost reduced from 270 to 225 to be more inline with enhanced costs in general."
  - balance: "Infectors will now actually inject toxin through rigs, rigs don't magically stop most poison anymore."
  - balance: "Cost of some abilities reduced for enhanced infectors, notably engorge, and growths, they can build propagators at a premium"
  - balance: "Enhanced infector HP reduced from 225 => 205 to give low armed humans more of a chance against one alone."

  - balance: "You can now overdose on dylovene at 30+ units, causing burns."
  - balance: "Necromorphs will now spawn within 3 tiles of spawners like the marker, nests. (Previously 10)"

  - balance: "Puker & spitter shots deal less damage up front. Especially puker longshot"
  - balance: "Acid shots and vomit tiles will now damage rigged people over time, though wearing a rig offers increased protection. If you don't wear shoes, expect to suffer."
